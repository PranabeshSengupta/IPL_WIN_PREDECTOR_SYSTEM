### 🏏 IPL Win Predictor System using AI/ML

The **IPL Win Predictor System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the winning probability of a team in an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match. This project leverages historical match data, team statistics, and live match parameters to provide real-time win probability estimates using predictive modeling.

#### 🧠 Key Features:
- Predicts match outcome probabilities during live matches or pre-match scenarios
- Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost)
- Analyzes features like team scores, wickets, overs, run rate, venue, and toss outcome
- Visualizes prediction output with user-friendly interface

#### 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Web Framework (Optional):** Flask or Streamlit for interactive frontend  
- **Data Source:** IPL match datasets (from Kaggle or similar sources)

#### 📈 Outcomes:
- Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on historical IPL match data
- Built a functional interface for users to input match conditions and receive live win predictions
- Demonstrated practical use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model deployment
